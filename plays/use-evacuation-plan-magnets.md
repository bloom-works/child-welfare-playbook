Families often forget to complete their required fire and/or tornado evacuation practice throughout the year and donâ€™t have this information available at license renewal. A dry-erase magnet reminds families to practice and serves as easy documentation that they did so.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Use a template like [this one](/static/assets/Emergency%20Fridge%20Decoration.pdf){target=_blank} to print and laminate your own magnets.
