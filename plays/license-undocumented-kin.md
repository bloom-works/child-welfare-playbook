It's _not_ a federal requirement for kinship caregivers to be in the country legally in order to get licensed â€” this is a pervasive myth. These caregivers should also be eligible for licensing and financial support.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Build trust with caregivers. If they think you'll report them to authorities for their immigration status, they won't work with you. Make it clear that your focus is only making sure the involved youth have a safe and supported placement.

* Conduct name-based background checks.

* Limit documentation of undocumented status. Don't document immigration status (whether documented or not) in your IT system.

* Remove state licensing requirements for residency or citizenship. This is not required under federal law, so any state requirements are you getting in your own way.

* Look for other household members to license. As a workaround, you can license a household member who does have a documented immigration status.

## Who's doing this

**New Mexico** licenses undocumented family members by conducting name-based background checks in place of fingerprints for family members with immigration status concerns.
