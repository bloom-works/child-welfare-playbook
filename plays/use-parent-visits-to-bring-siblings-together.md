Court-ordered visits for parents are another opportunity to bring separated sibling groups together.{.t-large}

    costs:
      - None
    benefits:
      - More sibling visits

## How to do this

* Make it normal practice for parent/child visits to include an entire sibling group, unless specific circumstances warrant a different situation.

* Do not count visits with parents as sibling visits; these should be in addition.
