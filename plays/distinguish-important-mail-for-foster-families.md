Foster families report feeling inundated with mail, from policies and forms and to announcements and new trainings. This mail may stack up in a pile, risking that time-sensitive mail goes unopened.{.t-large}

Put a sticker or draw a colored circle on important mail sent to foster parents, to clearly identify which envelopes are critical to open and which can be set aside.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Put a sticker or colored circle on critical mail, such as renewal letters. Communicate with families early on that they need to open and respond to any mail with this particular marking.

Choose your priority mail wisely. If you put a sticker on every envelope, this technique will stop being effective.

    costs:
      - Low to no cost
    benefits:
      - Help families respond to requirements quickly, like returning renewal
        documentation
