Caregivers, whether kinship caregivers or general resource families, need support too, and they won't be able to get 100 percent of that support from your agency. Identifying natural supports early on can help activate those supports when they're needed.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Update your home study process to include identifying natural supports. Home study specialists should talk through different hypothetical scenarios with the caregiver to prompt brainstorming of what supports they would need and who they would reach out to. Families can write these plans down.
