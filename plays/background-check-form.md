The process and timeframe for out-of-state abuse and neglect registry checks — commonly called Adam Walsh checks — vary quite a bit from state to state. To get foster families approved faster, start out-of-state background checks early.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state duringyour initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

* Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

* Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

* Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

* If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.

## Outcome data

We’re still collecting concrete data. But we believe that this will shorten the time it takes to approve foster families who’ve lived out of state.


    costs:
      - Staff time at orientation
    benefits:
      - Higher completion rates and greater caregiver satisfaction if they can
        discuss the form with a case worker before submitting
      - Ability to correct errors in real-time
      - Eliminates the need to follow-up for forms
