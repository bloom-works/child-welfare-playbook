Sibling connections are invaluable. If siblings end up separated despite all efforts to keep them together, systems should have policies in place that require regular visits and other communication, and ongoing efforts to reunite the siblings.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Copy policy language like Oklahoma's (see below).

    inspiration: Michigan's IT system includes tickler reminders for workers when sibling visits are coming due.
    costs:
      - None
    benefits:
      - More sibling contact and stronger connections

## Who's doing this

* **Frederick County, MD** requires separated siblings to have contact at least monthly [per policy](/static/assets/SSA%2015-18%20Parent-Child%20and%20Sibling%20Visitation.pdf){target=_blank}, and explicitly forbids withholding sibling visits as a form of discipline.

* **Indiana** requires at least two sibling visits per month.

* **Michigan** requires a minimum of a one hour visit per month.

* **Oklahoma** has a policy requiring ongoing efforts to keep siblings connected: Oklahoma's policy: (d) Child's contact with siblings. Per Section 471(a)(31) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(31)), 10A O.S. §§1-4-807 and 1-4-811, and Oklahoma Administrative Code 340:75-6-85, DHS makes ongoing reasonable efforts to place sibling groups together in both temporary and permanent placements. When joint placement of siblings is unsafe or contrary to the child's well-being, DHS must justify and document the justification for the decision, make monthly efforts to resolve the barriers to joint placement, provide frequent visitation, and arrange for ongoing interaction. Frequent contact, such as face-to-face visitation, phone calls, email, social media, or mail contact between siblings is arranged. DHS must make efforts to resolve barriers to joint placement and visitation a minimum of once a month.

* **Washington** has a robust policy:

  * Children placed apart from their siblings will have two or more face-to-face visits or contacts per month, unless there is an approved exception, as listed in Procedures Section 4. Additional approved forms of sibling contact are encouraged to support and maintain sibling relationships. Approved forms of contact include, but are not limited to: Telephone contact; Electronic contact through video chat or email.

  * Ongoing visitation is encouraged to promote and maintain the continuity of sibling relationships that existed prior to placement. This includes siblings who: Remained in the home at the time of removal; Aged out of foster care; Returned home; Are placed with a non-custodial parent; or Lived part-time in the home at the time of the sibling’s removal.
  * Sibling contact during family time meets the requirement for a sibling visit.
  * Shared planning meetings or court events do not meet the requirement for a sibling visit.
  * The first sibling visit must occur as soon as possible after placement.
  * Sibling visits will continue after a parent’s rights are terminated or relinquished unless an approved exception applies.
  * Sibling visits cannot be limited or used as a sanction for a child’s behavior or as an incentive to change a child’s behavior.
  * Sibling visit plans will be developed within 14 calendar days and in consultation with the out-of-home caregiver and child, when developmentally appropriate, unless an approved exception applies.
