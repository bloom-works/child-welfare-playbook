Support groups exist on social media for every topic you can think of, including foster care. Families in your system should have access to a social media based support group.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Appoint an outside group or agency to run the group. Families aren't comfortable in agency-run groups.

* Make sure the group has clear guidance for what to do if a member is in crisis or if there is suspected child abuse or neglect.

* Agency employees should not join these groups.

    costs:
      - None
    benefits:
      - Increased sense of community among foster parents
      - Indirect source of recruitment and retention

## Who's doing this

* **Michigan** experienced success augmenting its online foster parent training programs with a private Facebook group during the pandemic to help build community when people could not get together face to face.
