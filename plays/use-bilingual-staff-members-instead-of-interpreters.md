Interpreters are highly skilled but they may not have child welfare specific knowledge. This can make it difficult to translate important content (especially on the fly) during foster parent orientation and training or in ongoing interactions.{.t-large}

Relying on bilingual staff members whenever possible will help ensure that families receive and understand important information and trainings.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Ask caregivers about the language they are most comfortable interacting in as early as possible, by including this on inquiry forms or at the very start of an application process. Case workers should identify whether a relative placement needs a translator right away.

* Maintain a list of bilingual staff members. Identify work flexibilities that can allow them to take on occasional training responsibilities even if their normal responsibilities are in a different part of the agency.

* Use remote meeting capabilities so that families and staff members can work together even if they are in different parts of your state.

* County-administered systems can pool resources.
