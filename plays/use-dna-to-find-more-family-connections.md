This idea is more controversial, and it's important to consider a youth's privacy and wishes. However, ancestry DNA tools that can uncover more family members can be a useful tool for children in care with no or limited kinship placement options or supportive adults.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Develop a policy for when and how to use DNA services. You may want to limit this to youth with no viable kinship placements, or only older youth who can consent to participation, or only youth whose family of origin consents to its use.

* Couple counseling with the results. A DNA test might reveal unknown (or unexpected) parents, siblings, and other relatives. Strong supports need to be in place before a test so a youth can process the results.

    costs:
      - Usually under $100 per child
    benefits:
      - Can reveal kinship placement and support options that could not otherwise be found.

## Who's doing this

* **Colorado** uses Ancestry DNA as one tool in its family finding office.
