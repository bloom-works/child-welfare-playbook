title: Use social media for targeted foster family recruitment
tags: recruitment
---

Create and regularly update social media presences for your agency, so community members can learn more about foster parenting and how to support the foster youth in their community. Radio ads, billboards, television commercials, and other offline media can help spread awareness of the need for more foster families, but a regular cadence of social media posts can raise awareness with even more community members.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Work with a professional to develop targeted digital marketing campaigns for the types of families your system needs most. For example, you can target families in specific zip codes or school districts, retired nurses, military families, families who speak particular languages, and more.

    costs:
      - Varying costs associated with targeted digital campaigns. Once set up, these costs can go down dramatically.
    benefits:
      - Increased foster family recruitment of the exact types of families your children need.
