Some referral sources are biased, whether that means over-referring Black and Brown families, or referring a large percentage of families for reasons that do not warrant child welfare involvement. Evaluating your referral sources can help you to provide targeted training and feedback.{.t-large}

## Who's doing this
        
By [cross-referencing aggregate racial and demographic data with screening, testing, and CPS referral numbers](https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/safety/plan-safe-care/racial-equity), Washington State DCYF can direct anti-bias training to targeted referral sources and support policy that standardizes screening, testing, and referral practices.
