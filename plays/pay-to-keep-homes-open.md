When children experience a disruption, such as running away or requiring an inpatient treatment, their foster home bed is generally "closed." Paying the home to not only keep their bed open, but remain involved (e.g., visiting the hospital daily) can reduce placement disruption.{.t-large}

  costs:
    - Modest increase in maintenance payments
    - Ultimately saves costs in avoided group home placements
  benefits:
    - Placement stability

## How to do this

* Don't close a bed when a child runs away or is hospitalized.

* Review contracts with private agencies for criteria for closing out a bed.

## Who's doing this

* **Maryland** can pay to keep some homes open through its Center for Excellence grant.
