By the time child welfare is formally involved with a family, even for a screened-out report, there is an inherent element of coercion in offering “voluntary” services. Offering services to everyone with a new child is one point of engagement that can meet people when they may be most in need, without child welfare involvement. This support can be tiered based on the needs of each new parent, ranging from a supportive phone call to diapers to rental assistance, substance use treatment, or more.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* [Hello Baby](https://www.hellobabypgh.org/) provides supports for all new parents in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, with increasing supports for those that need them most.

* [Nashville Strong Babies](https://www.nashvillestrongbabies.com/) uses state birth records and Medicaid enrollment records to reach out to all new parents to offer a variety of supports. This tiered service started in a few targeted zip codes, but is now available to any new parent in Nashville. There are no income requirements and any family who is expecting a child, recently delivered, or parenting a child up to 18 months of age is eligible for support services.
