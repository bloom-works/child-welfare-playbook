Some families do not pass the inspection on the first try because they are missing one or more safety items that they didn’t know they needed to have (like a first aid kit or rope ladder). This can cause delays in the licensing process, as the inspector must go back a second time.{.t-large}

Providing a safety inspection checklist ahead of time will allow families to prepare for specific requirements and thereby prevent delays in the licensing process.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Make the safety inspection checklist available in multiple places and at multiple points during the process. For example, you can include the checklist:

* In an orientation packet

* Online with other application materials

* In the appointment reminder (either printed on the back or included as a second page)

* With a renewal reminder

* In your online licensing tracker application, if you have one

    costs:
      - Free
    benefits:
      - Increases the chances that a family will pass the safety inspection on
        the first visit
      - Saves staff time and resources by decreasing the chance that the
        inspector will need to return for a second visit
      - Decreases delays in licensing process
