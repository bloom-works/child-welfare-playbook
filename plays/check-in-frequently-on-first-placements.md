No matter how many hours of training they've had, it's a different experience once a child is placed in your home. This is particularly the case for kinship caregivers who may have had no notice their life was about to change. A little extra support during this transition period can go a long way towards making a placement successful and retaining foster homes for the long term.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Update your practices to include regular check-ins with resource families after they take their first placement. The specific person who should check in may vary by agency, but it should be a consistent person. Kinship caregivers should also get these calls. Milestones might include the first night, right before any key meetings, the first day a child attends school (if different from the first day of placement), and at least once a week for the first month.

* Ask open-ended questions. How's it going? Do they need anything? Do they have any questions? This is a great opportunity to identify any additional supports that may be needed and get them in place proactively.
