title: Increase foster family retention with renewal check-ins

Use renewal as an opportunity to touch base with families about their current needs and goals. Families that are feeling overwhelmed might benefit from respite or taking lower-need children for a time, while families that are gaining experience may be ready to take on higher-need placement.{.t-large}

With foster homes in such high demand, it can be all too easy to keep making placements in a home until the family burns out and quits. Using renewal as an opportunity to check-in helps retain families longer. Additionally, it may not be obvious when a family is ready to take on more responsibility and train for higher-need placement. Renewal offers a natural opportunity for these conversations.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Keep a spreadsheet or calendar of renewal dates. Before the license renewal process begins, schedule a check-in call with the family. Familiarize yourself with their current and recent placements prior to the call.

If a family has or recently had a stressful placement or disruption, consider options that might give them a break, including stepping down to take a lower-need placement, being placed on hold, or becoming a respite placement.

If a family has become more experienced and seems interested, use this conversation to talk to them about what a higher-need placement might look like and what trainings or experiences are available to them.
