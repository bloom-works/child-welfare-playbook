Foster children often have to move schools or live with strangers who do not share their language or culture. Sometimes, a matching family is available for a child who otherwise does not have a strong match, but the placement team cannot see that family because they have not yet completed the application process.{.t-large}

Include families who have applied but not yet completed their license in your placement searches. When a child otherwise has no strong match, prioritize licensing a matching pending family.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Include pending families in your placement searches. If there is a match, placement and licensing teams can work together to understand what steps must happen right away to license the family, and which steps might be able to wait until after placement. If the child does not have to move right away, arrange visits or other interactions with the matching family as they complete the licensing process.

In some jurisdictions, a judge can order a placement with a family that is not yet licensed but is otherwise a strong match for a child.

## Who's doing this

* Frederick County, MD pays close attention to new families in the application process, with an eye towards the youth currently in need of a placement or a better-fitting placement. When they identify a match, they work with the family to prioritize their application process.
