Create and regularly update social media presences for your agency, so community members can learn more about foster parenting and how to support the foster youth in their community. Radio ads, billboards, television commercials, and other offline media can help spread awareness of the need for more foster families, but a regular cadence of social media posts can raise awareness with even more community members.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Make a Facebook page for your department and create a regular schedule of content. Include things like upcoming events, employee profiles, profiles of children who are available for adoption, upcoming orientations or trainings, FAQs, and ways for people to support foster youth without necessarily becoming a foster parent.

If you do not already have a social media policy, publish one. [Here are our recommendations](/recommendations/social-media-policy).
