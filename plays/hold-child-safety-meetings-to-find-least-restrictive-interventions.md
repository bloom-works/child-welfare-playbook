title: Hold Child Safety Meetings to Find the Least Restrictive Interventions

When safety concerns arise in a child welfare case, removal does not always have to be the outcome. A Child Safety Meeting that includes the parent, the child (if they’re old enough), their supports, and skilled child welfare staff can sometimes identify an alternate intervention.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Oklahoma holds a Child Safety Meeting (CSM) any time the child's current situation warrants consideration of a safety intervention. Even if an emergency intervention was made (e.g., removing the child from the home), they still strive to hold a CSM within two days.

A CSM includes:
  * The parents (though if there are allegations of domestic violence, a separate CSM is held for each parent)
  * The child (if they are under 12, the team may decide not to invite them, but to still find a way to represent their wants and needs)
  * The family’s supports (they reach out to as many family and supports as possible; this has shown to positively impact better outcomes for children and families)
  * Agency staff

While agency staff have the final decision about the way forward, a CSM gives the entire team a chance to discuss and come up with solutions that meet a specific family’s needs.

Oklahoma credits CSMs with an increased ability to serve children served preventatively and as a support in its safe reduction in the number of kids in out-of-home care.
