When siblings are separated in foster care and then one or more of them are adopted, it can be even greater trauma if adoptive parents cut off contact with their siblings. It should be possible to include ongoing sibling visitation, same as open adoptions can allow for visits with birth parents. When siblings are old enough, they will find one another again -- why allow for gaps in that connection?{.t-large}
