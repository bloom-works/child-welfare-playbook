Childcare can be an insurmountable barrier to adults completing necessary licensing steps or to attending regular training and/or recognition events. You can fix this by providing childcare on-site.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Prioritize childcare options for kinship caregivers who need to complete required agency steps to maintain their kinship placeent, such as a fingerprinting session or a medical exam.

* If agency policy allows, look for community members who can volunteer to provide childcare. This can be a smart recruitment strategy to introduce more people to youth in care and the idea of fostering!

* Depending on your agency's policies around childcare providers, you may need to perform background checks or other steps to assess childcare providers ahead of time.

* Childcare should be for children in foster care as well as other children in the home. The care itself doesn't have to be fancy; putting on a movie can be enough.

* Make sure that kinship caregivers are eligible for this childcare, too.
