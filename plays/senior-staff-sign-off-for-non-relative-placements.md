Case workers don’t want to wake a director in the middle of the night to sign-off on a non-relative placement. Requiring this level of sign-off incentivizes early family finding and may prevent placements in group homes. {.t-large}

## How to do this

* Require senior staff sign-off for non-kin placements, no matter the time of day.

* Require sign-off on every placement: initial placements, subsequent placements, and any congregate care placements.

* The senior staff member should ask questions about what kin-finding activities have been conducted and about future kin-finding plans.

* For placement changes planned in advance, this process may look different than for emergency placements.

    costs:
      - New or updated policy requiring senior staff sign-off on non-kin placements.
      - 'Clear process for sign-off, including: exactly which senior staff member is responsible at any given time, recommended questions the senior staff member should ask about kin-finding progress, and senior staff contact information.'
      - Resources for kin-finding; this is not an effective tactic if your placement desk has no viable ways to find kin.
    benefits:
      - Incentivizes finding more kinship placement options
      - Helps prevent placement in group homes

## Who's doing this
* New Mexico has a policy that a Director must sign-off on any placement with non-kin, whether general foster care or a group home, even if it’s the middle of the night.

* New York's [kinship firewall policy](https://www.grandfamilies.org/Portals/0/Documents/Wikihow/20-OCFS-ADM-18%20kinfirst%20firewall.pdf?ver=aRW2qPM7j_EMROWXTct8SA%3d%3d){target=_blank}
