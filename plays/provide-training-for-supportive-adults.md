Adults who care about children in care want to be helpful, but they may not know how. Offering training and supports to supportive adults (who do not have placement) can help them be a more active and supportive presence in the lives of our children.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Talk to supportive adults to find out what they need. Some might benefit from trauma-informed trainings, but others may simply need encouragement to proactively reach out to youth and ideas for what activities to do and what questions to ask.

* Make existing trainings available to supportive adults. This shouldn't cost your system extra money, but provides extra resources to a broader array of supports. Send emails or share pamphlets about upcoming trainings with all the [supportive adults you have captured](/recommendations/ask-about-supportive-adults).

  costs:
    - None

## Who's doing this
