Using an expansive legal definition of kin allows staff to find more placement options for youth more quickly, and can mean more adults qualify to be emergency placements.{.t-large}

Even if a connection cannot serve as a placement, youth need as many supportive adults around them as possible. Maintaining an expansive legal definition of kin will allow you to create a broader support system for youth.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* The recommended definition of kin is: “Individuals related to a child by blood, marriage, tribal custom, and/or adoption and other individuals who have an emotionally significant relationship with the child or the child’s parents or other family members (often referred to as ‘fictive kin’).”

* Multiple child welfare advocates [came together](https://www.regulations.gov/document/ACF-2023-0001-0002/comment?filter=new%20america){target=_blank} to unanimously recommend the above definition of kin to the federal government as part of the comment period on the kin-specific licensing rule.

* Adopt this definition verbatim, or adjust your existing legal definition to encompass all of these categories of kin, for purposes of who qualifies for emergency placement, for kin-specific licensing waivers/exemptions, and for the upcoming kin-specific licensing process.

    costs:
      - Potential legislative change, although in some agencies, the definition of kin is in policy.
      - Significant time updating policies, forms, training, and other collateral to adapt to an expanded definition.
    benefits:
      - More supportive adults found and engaged in a youth’s life
      - Kinship care can be a more stable placement option for youth
      - Avoids placement in group homes or foster homes with other unrelated youth
