Safety inspections often identify minor items that need to be fixed before passing inspection, such as repairing a window or purchasing a newer crib. These minor items need to be validated by an inspector and require a return visit.{.t-large}

Allowing foster families to send photos to confirm the resolution of minor pending items will prevent delays in the licensing process.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Create a list of inspection items that can be resolved via photograph,
like beds, smoke detectors, and home repairs.

* Instruct families with a minor pending item to email a photograph once the item has been resolved. Store the photo with the family’s file. Here is a [sample email](/static/assets/resolve_minor_pending_items_asset){target=_blank} for this practice.

* If you’re creating or currently use a foster family online portal, request the ability for families to upload attachments, which would include these photos. Here is a [sample IT request](/static/assets/resolve_minor_pending_items_asset2){target=_blank} to add such a feature.

costs:
  - Low to no cost
benefits:
  - Save staff time by reducing the need for return visit
  - Reduce the amount of time to complete the inspection process
  - Prevents the loss of placement options
