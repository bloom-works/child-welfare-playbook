When you call or text a (potential) client to offer them services, what name comes up? What information comes up if they search your phone number? Ensuring this information is accurate and friendly can increase your engagement rates by helping prove you’re not a spammer.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* _Update Your Caller ID Name_
  * The name that appears as your phone number’s caller ID is known as a CNAM record. Updating your display name may require contacting your telephone provider, and/or paying a small monthly fee to upgrade to “advanced” caller ID.
  * Test what name appears on the [Caller ID Test website](https://calleridtest.com/). (This requires free registration.)

* _Update Search Engine Listings for Your Phone Number_
  * List your phone number prominently on your official website to increase the chances of this result at the top of any searches for that number.
  * Make sure that any Google, Yelp, or other map-based listing has the accurate phone number, too. If there are other websites that come up in a search for your organization name, especially local community websites, try to update those listings with your phone number.
