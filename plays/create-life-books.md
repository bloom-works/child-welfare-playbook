A life book captures a child's key milestones and relationships, and it should follow them throughout (and after) their time in care.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Print a lifebook template.

* Make completing the lifebook a formal resource parent responsibility. Check on its contents during regular check-ins such as monthly visits.

* Make copies of the lifebook for the family members of origin on a regular cadence. This should be at least quarterly.

* Make sure a child's lifebook follows them by including it in any move checklists, as well as in any permanency (e.g., aging out, adoption) checklists.
