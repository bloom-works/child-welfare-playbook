Many youth do not know what programs are available to them. Case workers are often managing so many cases that they donâ€™t always have time to explain every available program. This means that youth may miss out on opportunities to prepare for independence.{.t-large}

Instead of requiring case workers to explain each program directly, make it possible for older youth to look through a list of available programming and choose the topics most relevant to them.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Share a printed or emailed list of all programs with youth. Ask them to circle or highlight those that interest them.

You can also create a programming calendar online and allow youth to RSVP for programs of interest, using a free tool like Google Forms or Eventbrite.

    costs:
      - Free
    benefits:
      - Increases data on what programs are of most interest to youth (not just
        what youth attend).
      - Prevents youth from missing opportunities to prepare for independence
