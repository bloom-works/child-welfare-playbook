Examining inquiry data is one way you can help focus your recruitment efforts on the communities or neighborhoods where you most need homes but are receiving the fewest inquiries. Compare your inquiry data against any data you have about the characteristics of foster homes you need the most (e.g. zip codes where children most often experience removal). You can then clearly identify gaps where recruitment efforts can be focused.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Track data from your inquiry form (like caregiver’s interests, tribal status, language spoken, or zip code) against the characteristics you most need in foster families. You can then prioritize licensing matching families, while expanding or focusing your recruitment efforts in the communities where you have the biggest gaps in need.

    costs:
      - Low to no cost
    benefits:
      - Wider pool of appropriate placement options
      - Increased foster family recruitment

## Who's doing this

* Prince George’s County tracks the zip codes of new inquiries against the zip codes where they most need placement options, and then focuses recruitment efforts on the missing zip code areas.
