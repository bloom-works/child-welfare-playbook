Every child welfare system needs more ways to support and retain their best foster families. Find opportunities to formally recognize your current foster families, through awards, events, or gifts. These recognition opportunities create positive word of mouth from current foster families that attract more families to sign up to foster.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Start a recognition program. Even a certificate and a personal note can go a long way towards making a foster family feel valued and appreciated (and all their friends will see the certificate on the wall). You can also commission local businesses to donate free or discounted items as awards or gifts for current families.

    costs:
      - Moderate to no cost
    benefits:
      - Increased foster family retention
      - Increased positive word of mouth from current foster families

## Who's doing this

* Washington, D.C. has “squads” of foster families who support one another. Squads have monthly get-togethers and events, which can include recognition awards and modest prizes. The squads build camaraderies and help one another through challenges. Each year, there is a competition to see which squad recruits the most new families, with a ceremony and gift card prizes for the winning squad.

* Frederick County, MD hosts regular events for current foster families (pivoting them to Google Meet during the pandemic). They have also recognized foster families through a variety of events and strategies including: an annual adults-only reception for foster families (with free, on-site childcare); a drive through celebration where foster families who drove by the office could pick up ready to heat catered meals; drive by caravans where case workers and foster families drive by houses with signs and music; recognition baskets for foster families that included fun items like board games, puzzles, and snacks; welcome baskets for new foster families that include the Department handbook, a water bottle, mugs, and books for both parents and children.

* Ohio uses billboards to recognize individual foster families. Some families take friends and picnics to visit their billboard!

* Indiana works with local businesses to make a variety of discounts and offers available for their foster families.
