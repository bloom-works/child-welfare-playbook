Becoming a foster parent is a big step, and many potential foster parents need more human interaction to reassure them through the process. Call or meet with potential foster families when they submit an inquiry, instead of relying on automated emails and mailings. Speaking with potential families can help clarify expectations and get potential caregivers comfortable with moving to the next step.{.t-large}

Additionally, when there’s too much automation upfront, families for whom fostering is not a good fit can get far into the process before they have an opportunity to talk with a real person. By speaking with potential families early, you can help dissuade families for whom fostering is not a good fit (e.g. families only interested in adopting infants), so your agency can focus on the families that best meet the needs of your current youth.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Look for opportunities to include a human interaction, such as a phone call, early in the inquiry process. If you don’t have the staff resources for this, consider hiring current foster parents to help.

    costs:
      - Low to no cost
    benefits:
      - Avoids losing potential families who would have signed up in the future
      - Allows potential families to gain more information and apply quickly
      - Identifies families who may not be a good fit early on

## Who's doing this

Dr. Patricia Aviles-Cubillos, a foster parent recruiter with Fairfax County Department of Family Services, provides her own phone number to families to register for orientation, instead of having an online signup form. This creates an opportunity for an early conversation, where she can get to know the family, and they can ask questions.'
