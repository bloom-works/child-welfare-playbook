title: Find alternatives to physical mail for sharing documents with youth
tags: ["extended-foster-care", "play"]

Many foster youth do not have reliable physical addresses, making it difficult for them to receive physical mail. In a multi-state discovery sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://thinkof-us.org/){target=_blank} found as many as 30% of mailed calendars were returned to sender. This means that as many as 30% of youth never learn about programs being offered.{.t-large}

Switching from physical mail to using online calendars, email, and text messages to share information about programming and other materials will help ensure that youth do not miss important information.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Programming calendars can be posted online and emailed to youth. You could also use an online calendar that allows others to subscribe to your events, like Eventbrite. A photo of the calendar could also be texted to youth.

    costs:
      - Free (you may even save money on postage and printing)
    benefits:
      - Eliminates returned mail rates of up to 30%
      - Youth are more aware of program options

## Outcome data
