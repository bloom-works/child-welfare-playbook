Social media is widely used across cultural, geographic, and economic groups. This makes social media a powerful and unique tool for finding family members of youth in foster care.{.t-large}

Other people-finding tools — like credit searches — have limited databases. For example, you have to have a credit history to appear in most of them, entirely missing kin with thin or non-existent credit files.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Search popular social media sites like Facebook for known family members, such as a youth’s parents or older siblings. From there, look through public messages, photos, and friend lists to identify additional connections and message them. (This message should not reveal identifying details.)

Child welfare systems should _require_ social media searches as a core part of kin finding activities.

Make sure to have a [robust social media](/recommendations/social-media-policy) policy in place.

## Outcome data

New Mexico increased initial kinship placements from 3% to over 40% in one year by shifting to practices that included using social media to identify kin.

    costs:
      - Social media training
      - Employee time

    benefits:
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as lifelong support
        for vulnerable youth
      - Find  kin your agency would not otherwise find
      - Avoid placing children in general foster care who actually have kinship placement
