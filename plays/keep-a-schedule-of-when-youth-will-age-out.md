Staff often do not have an easy way to track which of their youth are nearing the date that they will age out. This makes it difficult to plan and communicate effectively.{.t-large}

Keep a chronological list of the youth you serve, sorted by their anticipated final day, so that their needs can be met before they exit care.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Create a list in Excel or your case management system where staff can easily view which youth are closest to aging out. In Excel, you can enter the youthâ€™s transition date and sort your list into categories, like youth exiting care in the next one month, six months and 12 months.
