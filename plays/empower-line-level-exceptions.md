title: Empower licensing workers to approve relative licensing exceptions

When the licensing workers who interact with and really know a family get to make decisions about how to approve or mitigaten non-safety exceptions for relatives, everyone benefits. A supervisor or area administrator who has never met a family is often not the best person to make a judgement call, and that can lead to denials that lack nuance â€” which ultimately means fewer kids in kinship care. Localized decision making means faster and higher licensing rates for relatives.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Review your exception approval process. Consider removing some or all higher approval steps. If this is too drastic a shift, start with making a list of exceptions that licensing workers can mitigate directly, and only require higher level approvals for others. For example, some systems let licensing workers approve everything except criminal histories.

* Don't have an exception approval process at all. Instead, [move mitigation and alternate plans within the normal process](/recommendations/normalize-relative-licensing-exceptions) (e.g., the home study template).

    costs:
      - None
    benefits:
      - Clear and faster decision making
      - Fairer decisions for kinship caregivers

## Who's doing this

* **Rhode Island** reduced licensing contacts with a family to one team of 2-3 people max.

* **Indiana** has a weekly meeting focused on how **TO** license every family. This attitude generates solutions, not denials.
