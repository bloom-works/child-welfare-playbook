Child welfare systems can box themselves into a corner by being overly specific when describing foster parent licensing requirements. Flexible language around certain requirements means more caregivers, especially kin caregivers, can get licensed.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Review your current language for overly-specific requirements. For example, don't try to define a bedroom.

* Solicit feedback from licensing workers about which of your licensing requirements trip them up, whether because the verbiage is confusing, or too specific. In particular, seek stories about times when specific requirements meant that an otherwise qualified kinship caregiver couldn't get licensed.

## Who's doing this

* **California** does not define a "bedroom" so it does not have to worry about square footage, number of doors or windows, or other details that frequently trip up other systems during the approval process. This is especially important for kinship caregivers who may not have the resources to provide every child with a dedicated bedroom.

* **Rhode Island** created a kinship licensing "playbook" that encourages conversations and collaboration over a specific list of very detailed requirements.
