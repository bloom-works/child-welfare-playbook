title: Give cash or prepaid cards for youth stipends

Older youth often rely on their stipends to cover food and basic necessities. Giving cash or prepaid cards, instead of store-specific gift cards, is more useful and will go farther for youth purchasing groceries and other necessities.{.t-large}

In a multi-state learning sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/){target=_blank} found that when youth received Target gift cards, they often engaged in a complicated workaround: they purchased miscellaneous Target items, then returned them in batches to receive cash refunds in increments of $10. They then used that cash to buy food at other stores.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Give youth cash.

* Use direct deposit to distribute youth stipends.

* Send payment with a cash app like [Venmo](https://venmo.com/about/product/){target=_blank} or [Cashapp](https://cash.app/){target=_blank}. Allow youth to choose the app theyâ€™d prefer to receive funds in.

* Give youth a prepaid cash card such as a [Visa gift card](https://usa.visa.com/pay-with-visa/find-card/get-prepaid-card){target=_blank}, that can be used anywhere. Ensure that it has no transaction fees.

* Provide youth with a gift card of their choosing.
