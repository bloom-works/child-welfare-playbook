Keeping track of a youth’s connections can get complicated, and a genogram offers a helpful, visual solution. By organizing existing contacts using a genogram, you can see key relationships easily and start identifying possible additions.{.t-large}

## How to do this

You can use a genogram tool like the ones we list below or simply a blank piece of paper or dry-erase board. Here are some tips:

* Start making a family tree to show a child’s connections.

* Include all important connections, even if they aren’t legal or blood relatives.

* Use the tree to generate new leads and to keep track of your contacts and progress.

* [The Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/){target=_blank} — which has a 95% success rate — recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it.

There are some additional tools that staff may consider using. These tools are helpful on their own, but work best when coupled with a genogram:

* [Accurint](https://www.accurint.com/){target=_blank}: Records search from LexisNexis.

* [TLOxp](https://www.tlo.com/){target=_blank} (The Last One): Records search from TransUnion, one of the three credit bureaus.

* [Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/){target=_blank}: This tool can be helpful for completing genograms.

    costs:
      - Genogram software (optional, but helpful)
      - Time for employees to train on creating genograms and to actually create them for each child
    benefits:
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as lifelong support
        for vulnerable youth
      - Find some kin your agency would not otherwise find
      - Makes it easy for multiple workers to collaborate on a child’s
        supportive network, and to follow up with those connections over time

      * In Ohio, the statewide average is 151 kin per child and the record is finding 609 kin for one child.

      * The [Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/){target=_blank} — which has a 95% success rate — recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it, as does [30 Days to Family](https://forchildwelfare.org/30-days-to-family/30-days-to-family-faq/).

      * In New Mexico, “All investigations now require the completion of a genogram, a map of family relationships and history, and for the genogram to be uploaded in the case record.” [source](https://klvg4oyd4j.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/PublicFiles/0bafdaa4e38b4b6292f0c68ed362e88d/c538c771-ed32-4305-8d4d-c6f18fabda99/App_B_T_1dot1_Retention_and_Recruitment_of_Resource_Families_-3-28-2022.pdf){target=_blank}
