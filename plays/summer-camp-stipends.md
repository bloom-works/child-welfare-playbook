Foster youth may miss out on the childhood experience of summer camp because their foster parents can't afford it. While some camps specialize in foster youth and/or in bringing separated foster siblings together, kids in care deserve to attend camp with their peers, too.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Offer summer camp stipends to foster families, including unlicensed kinship caregivers.

  costs:
    - Cost of camp
  benefits:
    - Youth in care get normal childhood experiences
    - Summer camp is an indirect form of respite for foster parents

## Who's doing this

Virginia provides a $500 stipend for summer camp to every child.
