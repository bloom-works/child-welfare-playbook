Current foster parents who do not work for your Department can provide additional empathy and perspectives that can help new families decide to sign up, or decide to expand their training or placement preferences. Hiring current foster parents to assist as co-trainers in new or continuing trainings (or for orientations or early home visits) may also help retain the foster parents who are hired.{.t-large}
