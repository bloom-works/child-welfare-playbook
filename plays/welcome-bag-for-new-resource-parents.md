Retention starts at the start! Drop off a welcome bag to new resource parents with a note that welcomes them to fostering and includes a combination of useful items and fun treats for the whole family.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Include a mix of contents, some practical and some just fun. Consider the whole family (the parents, the youth in care, and any children or other adults already in the home - perhaps even a pet!).

* If your agency lacks the budget for welcome bags, forward this page to your local community supporters to make bags on your behalf.

* Kinship caregivers should get bags, too, although you might adjust the tone and message (and possibly the contents) of the delivery accordingly. You can still thank them for their sacrifices and include family activities like a game, craft project, or treats.

## Who's doing this

**Frederick County, MD** visits the home of resource families after they get their license to drop off a welcome bag that includes a [resource family handbook](/recommendations/create-a-resource-parent-handbook), a water bottle, Foster Love mugs, two books for adults, and a children's book (The Invisible String).
