title: Provide financial bonuses to foster families for recruitment referrals

Providing financial bonuses to current foster families who recruit more families is an additional way to financially support current families. This also incentivizes successful recruitment activities.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Work with your legal and finance teams to determine how you can provide financial stipends to families. You may have an existing recruitment or retention contract that allows you to make these payments already.

Make sure there is a clear way to track referral sources and milestones, so families are fairly recognized and compensated. Make sure to connect the financial bonuses with milestones like recruited families completing licensure or accepting a payment.

If you cannot make a cash bonus payment, consider other forms of prizes such as an award, a recognition event, or gift cards.

## Who's doing this

* Washington, D.C. challenges “squads” of resource families to recruit more families. For each family that gets licensed, the referring family gets a $500 bonus. The squad that collectively recruits the most new licensed families gets a celebratory event with prizes and food. During the pandemic, they delivered meals via DoorDash in lieu of in-person celebrations.

* Montgomery County, MD provides current foster families a $500 bonus if they refer other families. The first $250 is payable when the new family receives its license, and the second is payable when they take their first placement.
