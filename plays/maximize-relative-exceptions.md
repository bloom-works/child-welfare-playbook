Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, which governs foster care maintenance payments and licensing, specifically says that states can make exceptions to any "non-safety" licensing requirements for relatives. Most states have artificially limited their flexibility around exceptions â€” but you can fix this by following in the footsteps of states that have maximum flexibility.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Borrow policy verbiage from states with maximum flexibility to grant exceptions to relatives. The only licensing requirements that are "safety" issues are those that would prevent placement (such as a disqualifying criminal history). Here's the law, so you can easily reference it: "(D) that a waiver of any standards established pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be made only on a case- by-case basis for non-safety standards (as determined by the State) in relative foster family homes for specific children in care."

* If you currently allow _some_ exceptions, change this to allow all non-safety issues. Do not have a specific list of relative exceptions.

* If you don't currently allow any licensing exceptions for relatives, start! Use states that already have this flexibility, listed below, as a guide (and feel free to reach out to us for help).

* Carefully define "safety" and "non-safety." This trips up many systems. If a kinship caregiver is safe enough to place, then by definition, any other issues are non-safety issues. A safety issue is only something that would cause you to immediately remove a child from that person's care. Under this definition, **ALL** kinship caregivers with placement should qualify for a license.

* Acknowledge there will be a small handful of exceptions. You may have a kinship caregiver with a disqualifying federal criminal history but is a court-ordered placement. In this case, the caregiver won't be eligible for IV-E reimbursement. But this should be an extremely rare situation.

    costs:
      - None
    benefits:
      - All kinship caregivers will get financial support
      - More kinship caregivers in systems that do not currently have exceptions

## Who's doing this

* **Oklahoma** approves almost all of its kinship caregivers within 60 days of placement, with the liberal use of exceptions and no list of allowed exceptions. Here's [Oklahoma's policy](/static/assets/OK_Relative_Exceptions.docx){target=_blank}.

* **Washington DC** can waive anything except criminal history, and can license a kinship caregiver in as little as six HOURS.

* **New Hampshire** can waive any requirement upon request (though the caregiver has to request the waiver).
