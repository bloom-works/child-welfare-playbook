Case workers spend a significant amount of time on licensing paperwork, which is time they could otherwise spend directly with families or on evaluations. By providing clerical support for case workers, you can reduce the amount of paperwork that case workers are responsible for.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Hire one or more clerical workers (depending on the size of your office). You may be able to leverage clerical staff in another department or convert an existing position.

A clerical worker can send and receive physical mail and email, keep track of paperwork requirements for each family, track renewal requirements, send appointment reminders, track background check paperwork, and handle other clerical responsibilities.

    costs:
      - Cost of new staff
    benefits:
      - Increase the time case workers can spend with families
      - Increase the likelihood of effective evaluations
