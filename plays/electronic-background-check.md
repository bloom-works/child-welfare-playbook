To speed up the process and reduce application costs, offer ways for
  people to submit background check requests electronically. Requests through physical mail lead to longer wait times and more
  opportunity for clerical mistakes.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

* Make your request form computer-friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Web form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

* Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests as part of any future system modernization efforts.
