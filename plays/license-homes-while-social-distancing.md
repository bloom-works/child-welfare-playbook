Some child welfare systems have paused licensing for some or all new families in order to limit in-person contact, even though federal regulations do not require the licensing process to be conducted in person. Delays caused by stopping licensing can mean losing homes, especially relative placements, in a time when placement options are already severely limited.{.t-large}

Licensing new foster homes with minimal physical contact by conducting everything by email, phone, and video (except for fingerprinting and a single in-person safety walkthrough) can limit any delays and prevent the loss of placement options.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Conduct the initial safety walkthrough over video, during which case workers can identify safety concerns and make compliance plans. The final safety walkthrough can then be conducted in person, during a focused visit of no more than 20 minutes.

* For emergency relative placements, the in-person final safety walkthrough can be combined with the placement visit. Any follow-ups can be conducted over video.

* Conduct interviews over phone or video. If families lack technology equipment, connect them with [free Lifeline phone service](https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report){target=_blank} and [free Internet services](https://thinkofus.gitbook.io/command-center/resources/foster-youth/technology#i-cannot-afford-to-buy-access-to-the-internet){target=_blank}. You may also be able to [use federal funding to secure equipment for families](https://thinkofusteam.app.box.com/s/joy9mrzgr4yjw997tjdi5dib1z6f1y4v){target=_blank}.

* Resolve minor pending items with photos.

* Prioritize in-home and community-based fingerprinting. Mobile Livescan units reduce in-person time by allowing you to combine fingerprinting with the final safety walkthrough. Community-based fingerprinting sites like UPS stores remain open as essential businesses and provide a stress-free, fast environment for applicants to complete this requirement.

* Eliminate or temporarily suspend other in-person requirements. If your process requires a medical evaluation, allow a medical professional to complete the paperwork based on patients records or via a telehealth visit.

* Invest in online solutions that allow families to complete and track paperwork, attend and track orientations and trainings, and upload key documents.

* If your child welfare system has a unique requirement, like tuberculosis tests, evaluate whether such a unique requirement is necessary and remove or suspend it if possible.

    costs:
      - Software cost for online tracking system for families
      - Potential cost of mobile fingerprinting machine
    benefits:
      - 'Limiting in-person contact while also limiting delays in licensing '
      - Prevents the loss of placement options
      - May make it easier for families to complete all or some of the
        requirements

## Outcome data

States with contracts for community-based fingerprinting sites report the same processing times as before the pandemic. For more information on fingerprinting, see [How to ensure fingerprinting doesn’t stop your work?](https://thinkofus.gitbook.io/command-center/resources/agencies/support-foster-families/dont-let-fingerprinting-stop-your-work){target=_blank}

States that require tuberculosis tests and/or medical physicals report that these are the most difficult in-person requirements for families to complete during the pandemic.

From March to May 2020, the child welfare systems using the online tool [Binti](https://www.binti.com/){target=_blank} for foster parent licensing, which collectively serve approximately 17% of the nation’s foster youth, have:

* 2,715 online training orientations completed

* 3,560 online applications filled out, e-signed and submitted to agencies by families applying to be foster/adoptive families

* 1,154 families approved by agencies to be caregivers

* 1,798 families renewed their yearly approval

* 115,171 online case notes submitted by social workers

## Who's doing this

Rhode Island continued to license homes during the pandemic, limiting in-person contact to a single 20-minute walkthrough during which a mobile fingerprinting unit for all adult household members.
