title: Pay Kinship Caregivers Until They Get Licensed

Kinship caregivers are not eligible for receiving foster care stipends until they complete a licensing process. In most states, the can take 100s of days; and many states allow for kinship caregivers to remain unlicensed (unpaid) indefinitely. This lack of financial support can severely negatively impact the ability for a kinship caregiver to provide a stable placement.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Pay kinship caregivers from the first day they receive placement. This generally requires state funds.

* Streamlining your kinship licensing process, including maximizing non-safety exemptions, can get kinship caregivers licensed (and therefore paid) much faster.

  costs:
    - Significant state funds
  benefits:
    - Kinship caregivers can financially support their children


## Who's doing this

* **California**'s Emergency Caregiver Funding Program provides funding for up to 365 days to caregivers who receive placement before being approved.

* **Ohio** can provide kinship caregivers with payments for up to six months, from state funds, if the relative has an approved home study.

* **Michigan** can use state funds for unlicensed kinship caregivers.

* **Oklahoma** pays kinship caregivers for the first 60 days after placement, after which time they are usually licensed and eligible for regular maintenance payments. If the caregiver is still not licensed at 60 days, and Oklahoma determines the delay is due to the state, it will continue paying the kinship caregiver until they're licensed.
