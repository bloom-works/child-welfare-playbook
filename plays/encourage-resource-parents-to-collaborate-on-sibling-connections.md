title: Encourage resource parents of separated siblings to connect directly
tags: ["sibling-connections", "play"]

Sibling connection is about much more than a monthly in-person visit. It can be invites to school events, birthday calls and cards, and regular everyday connections like playing in the park on a nice day. Resource parents of separated sibling groups should collaborate to help keep them connected in large and small ways; this is not a responsibility of the system or social worker alone.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* When siblings are separated in care, their respective resource parents should be connected right away, unless there are case-specific reasons not to.

* Case workers can encourage resource parents to collaborate by gently checking in on a regular basis about how sibling visits are going. If parents are reticent, case workers should be empowered to set up an initial visit to break the ice.

* General foster parents (non-kin) should be expected to faciliate sibling connections through phone calls, video chats, and in-person visits. They should not have the option to opt-out of this responsibility.

    costs:
      - None
    inspiration: "Fairfax County, VA's [policy](LINK TO COLLEEN)."
    benefits:
      - If one sibling placement disrupts in the future, an established relationship with other siblings' foster parents may open the door to that placement taking in the additional siblings.
      - Maintains and builds strong sibling connections.

## Who's doing this

* **Fairfax County, VA** encourages its resource families to communicate in its [written policy](LINK TO COLLEEN).

* **Michigan** connects resource parents of separated children at the start of placements and encouraged to set up additional visits.

* **Frederick County, MD** introduces all resource parents of separated sibling groups, encourages an ongoing relationship between resource parents, especially if one resource parent is a kinship caregiver and the other is not.

* **Oklahoma** encourages resource parents with separated siblings to bring the children together as often as possible.

* **New Hampshire** promotes natural collaboration between parents and resource parents.

* **Washington DC**’s social worker team ensures resource parents understand the expectation for sibling visits and that the Agency supports this practice; in all, it’s a collected effort with the entire team. BOND Leads create activities where siblings who are separated can engage across Squad members (resource parents). Resource Parent Support Workers ensure families have connections and opportunities to get siblings together on their own as well.
