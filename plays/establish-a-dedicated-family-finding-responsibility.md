The old adage that “when it’s everybody’s job, it’s nobody’s job” rings especially true in kin-finding. While every team member can play a valuable role in identifying, reaching out to, and maintaining kin connections, it also needs to be somebody’s formal responsibility at the end of the day.{.t-large}

Whose responsibility may vary based on your agency; a small team may thrive when the child’s case worker is also responsible for kin-finding, while another agency may need a focused kin-finding team.{.t-large}

      * In Indiana, kin finding metrics are used in performance evaluations.

      * Wisconsin has a [concise guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vhn78eupW25aIhfTGSVri1rh2y_0GEQ9/view){target=_blank} for kin-finding responsibilities, including suggested meeting agendas.

      * Kevin’s Campbell’s Family Finding Model credits having a designated specialist whose primary job is to carry out kin-finding activities as a key piece of effective implementation.

## How to do this

* Determine the right place for kin-finding responsibility in your agency. If unsure, conduct a pilot to try out multiple arrangements, with feedback from employees.

* Make a process map of the kin-finding process and all its expected steps. Confirm that the responsibilities and resources are assigned correctly, and that no steps are skipped in the transition.

* Ask a variety of employees for their feedback. One team may be happy with a status quo, while another team may be frustrated that they regularly find available kin far into a child’s case.

* Detail metrics for success. New metrics should be rolled out slowly and with ample feedback. An example metric is % of initial kin placements (out of all placements).

* Empower team members who are ultimately responsible for kin-finding with the ability to make changes in other areas of the agency in support of kin–finding.

* Once determined, update position descriptions, performance reviews, and other collateral to make responsibilities clear.

* If you have a separate kin-finding team, require that they work with the child, the parents, and the child’s worker. Kin-finding cannot be done in isolation or without talking to the child and their parent(s) (if available).
