Whether due to time, money or transportation constraints, some families cannot acquire needed safety inspection items (such as rope ladders or oven locks). By providing these items to families in need, you can ensure that anyone who needs safety items can get them.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* **Collect critical items.** The most frequently needed items include
fire extinguishers, oven locks, baby gates, first aid kits and medication
lock boxes. There are several ways you may collect items like these:

  * You can collect donated items in new condition during a “safety inspection” drive, similar to a backpack or canned food drive. Here is sample language for a safety inspection drive.
  * You can work with local partners like churches to host a drive event or a fundraiser.
  * You can use Family Preservation Service dollars, an existing budgetary tool that can help acquire needed items when used for direct placement.

* **Distribute critical items.** Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your team to distribute critical safety items to families in need. To do so, keep a stash of essentials in easy-to-access locations like a designated supply closet or the trunk of a case worker’s car. You can also provide key items at a foster parent training or orientation.

    costs:
      - Low to no cost to collect donated items
      - Cost of purchasing new safety items
    benefits:
      - Saves staff time by reducing the need for case worker return visits
      - Increases the number of families passing inspection
