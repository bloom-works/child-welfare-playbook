Respite care gives foster parents a break, whether for date night or a trip out of state where a child is not allowed to tag along. Paying for respite, whether by providing funds or a respite provider, helps foster parents to avoid burnout and potentially support youth with higher levels of need.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Pay for respite for caregivers, including unlicensed caregivers. This can be a literal stipend, or you can provide paid respite by paying other respite homes a maintenance payment to provide respite.

* Normalize taking respite by proactively paying for it on a regular basis, instead of requiring families to apply for it.

* Continue to pay foster parents their normal rate on days they use respite.

  costs:
      - Upwards of $0.66 per day per child
    benefits:
      - Improved foster home retention
      - Respite providers might convert to licensed caregivers later
      - Paid respite can enable some caregivers to take on and support children with higher levels of need
