It's scary when youth run away or go missing while in care. Social media can be an effective way to find and communicate with AWOL youth. {.t-large}

## How to do this

* Search popular social media sites for the youth by name. Also review friends, posts, and comments on any known friend or family member profiles.

* While it may normally be against policy to send friend requests, this practice may be required in order to send a message to a youth with a private profile. Ensure your workers can use this flexibility when necessary.

* Stay calm. An open line of communication can help encourage youth to return, but it might not happen immediately. A line of communication can at least let you know if a youth is safe.
