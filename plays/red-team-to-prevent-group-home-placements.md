title: Use a red team to prevent placements in group homes
tags: ["finding-kin", "emergency-placements"]

Fewer youth will enter group homes if there is a team dedicated to finding alternative placements. A red team should be a diverse group of agency staff, who conduct kin research, construct a genogram, and ask youth directly about possible placements. The team should be empowered to rapidly brainstorm, make decisions, and pursue alternatives to group home placements.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* **Assemble a diverse team.** Strong team members will have a reputation for problem solving. Appoint a senior leader for the team.

* **Formally state the goal.** The goal of the red team is to find an alternative placement to group homes for every youth.

* **Require a red team meeting before any youth can be placed in a group home.** You may require a meeting before additional scenarios, such as placing a youth out of state or placing a youth in a general foster home with other unrelated youth.

* **Ask about connections.** As part of their process, the red team should construct a genogram and plan to ask youth about possible placement options.

    costs:
      - Staff time
    benefits:
      - Avoid placing children in general foster care or group homes who have
        kinship options
      - Staff may be able to increase initial kinship placements
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as supportive
        connections for youth

## Outcome data

**Rhode Island** has begun to depopulate group homes by requiring a red team before any group placement, or any placement into a home that already has at least one other unrelated foster child.

## Who's doing this

**Rhode Island** holds a red team meeting, led by the Chief of Staff of the Department, before a child is placed in a group home or in a general foster home with other unrelated foster youth. As part of the red team, the family finding office conducts kin research, the team constructs a genogram, and they ask the youth directly about possible placement ideas.
