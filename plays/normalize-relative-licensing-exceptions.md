Exceptions to licensing requirements for relatives don't have to be entirely separate forms or processes. Many systems incorporate this mitigation and decision making within the standard process, such as the home study template. In systems that allow relative nonsafety exceptions, these exceptions happen _more often than not_ â€” so instead of treating it as an exceptional circumstance, treat it as a routine one.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Move existing exception forms into your standard forms. This can largely be handled in the narrative sections of a home study.

* Find opportunities to [reduce the number and/or level of decision-makers for relative exceptions](/recommendations/empower-line-level-exceptions).

    costs:
      - None
    benefits:
      - Faster relative licensing
      - Streamlined process for employees

      number: 2

## Who's doing this

* **New Mexico** has a finite list of relative nonsafety waivers, but instead of requiring a separate form, it addresses exceptions in the same part of the home study where the topic comes up (e.g., capacity exceptions when surveying the home).

* **Rhode Island** and **Ohio** do not have a separate form to request exceptions, and instead incorporate mitigations throughout the home study.
