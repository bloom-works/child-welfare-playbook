By aligning licensing checklist items to specific statutes, you can help decision-makers understand the source of these legal requirements. This ensures that decision-makers clearly understand the source of a problem, so they can identify the most effective solution. For example, a landline telephone requirement creates a challenge for many families as most people are now in mobile-only households. By highlighting the statute behind this requirement, a decision-maker can better consider whether it is enough to change the requirement, or if the policy behind the requirement needs to be updated and modernized as well.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Create or locate a list of all checklist items.

* Identify the legal requirement for each item.

* Add the statute number next to each item on the checklist.

* Consider how you might update items that are challenging to families. Can you update the requirement, or does the policy need to be changed?

    costs:
      - Staff time

      - Facilitates the modernization of outdated policies
      - Enables more effective decision-making
