Filling out a form indicating interest in becoming a foster parent is a big step. When someone fills out an inquiry form, they might be ready to go right away, or they might need time and more information to think about making such a significant commitment. If too much time passes before they get a response, a potential caregiver may become discouraged, second guess themselves, or change their mind.{.t-large}

Set a required, short response time for following up with potential foster family inquiries. Responding quickly with more information makes you seem responsive and supportive to new families, gives primed applicants a way to get started and make a more informed choice about whether fostering is right for them, and can help weed out poor fits (e.g. families only looking to adopt infants). By providing information about additional ways to support foster youth, you can also help more hesitant families get and stay engaged.{.t-large}

    costs:
      - Low to no cost
    benefits:
      - Avoids losing potential families who would have signed up in the future
      - Allows potential families to gain more information and apply quickly

## How to do this

* Set a metric, ranging from one to seven days, for how quickly you will respond to new inquiries. This metric should be as short as possible, but realistic given your current staffing and resources. Track initial response times for new inquiries. If they begin to slip, work with your team to identify how to respond faster (such as increasing resources or using calendar reminders).

* Create an automated email with links to information on fostering. Consider adding tips for ways to support foster youth without becoming a foster parent. Provide a printed version for families who do not use email.

* Create a newsletter (email and/or print) to keep interested families engaged.

* Avoid high-pressure tactics. Some great caregivers can take years between submitting an inquiry and applying to be a foster parent.

## Who's doing this

* Ohio, a county-administered system, requires that all inquiries receive a response within seven days. They have developed a packet of materials to provide in response to new inquiries.

* Frederick County, MD sends interested families a list of 12 ways to support youth without becoming a foster parent (yet). This engagement strategy allows some families to dip their toe in the water and still provide meaningful support.
