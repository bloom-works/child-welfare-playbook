title: Raise Funds by Charging Service Providers Rent in a Community-Based Location
tags: ["prevention", "play"]

Most families have complex needs that require navigating multiple government services — and that usually means traveling to multiple government buildings, finding transportation to far-away locations, navigating intimidating security procedures, and waiting for long hours in uncomfortable waiting rooms. Not to mention needing the time off work and childcare to accomplish all this!{.t-large}
      
One jurisdiction had the brilliant idea to invite local government service providers like job coaches and unemployment guides to rent space in their community-based, easy-to-access family resource center. This is a win-win because it dramatically increases access to these services for the people who need them most, and it raises funds that can serve even more concrete needs.{.t-large}

## How to do this

Invite sought-after government service providers for benefits such as unemployment, job training/coaching, SNAP, WIC, SSA, and VA to hotel in your community-based family resource center building. This increases access to their services, reduces wait times for those in need, and raises funds. Plus, it’s likely that rent is already an available line item for these agencies, and therefore can serve as a new, low-paperwork, high-return funding source.

    costs:
      - May require startup costs to draft rental agreements and modify the space
    benefits:
      - Brings service providers into the community they serve
      - Raises more funds that can be used to provide services
      - Makes it easier for individuals in need to navigate their needs
      - Improves ability for multiple benefits to collaborate to help a particular individual or family
