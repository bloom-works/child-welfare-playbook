There is so much to do and there are so many emergencies to handle that it can be easy to assume that no news is good news in the case of your existing resource families, but this is not alway the case. Regular check-ins can surface issues of all sizes proactively, so you have enough time to fix individual or systemic issues before they cause you to lose families altogether.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Try to make check-ins a human interaction, instead of relying on a paper or electronic survey. This takes more time but gets much richer information and much higher response rates. The worker conducting the check-in should capture what they learn on a structured form for internal analysis and reporting.

* Make it as easy as possible for families to participate in check-ins. Work around their schedule, provide childcare, offer different meeeting options (in-person coffee or video chat or phone call).

* Incorporate check-ins with existing meetings. If you have a worker going to do a home visit anyway, make it a practice for them to talk to the caregiver privately about how they're doing and whether they have questions or unmet needs. The worker should capture this information and there should be clear steps for follow-up.

* Develop an agency practice for evaluating all check-in information at a regular cadence (such as quarterly or every six months) to look for high-level trends or themes that may indicate the need for new programs or supports, or changes. Sort information by area and by worker if you are in a larger system. You don't need a data scientist to spot problems.

* Make sure to check in with families at least quarterly, and at key milestones, such as right after initial placements, and especially after removals / reunifications.

* Provide caregivers an anonymous way to share more feedback.

## Who's doing this

* **Washington** conducts an annual caregiver survey and has a team that pays close attention to the responses.

* **Rhode Island** surveys caregivers with a survey after they complete training, and after their initial placement.
