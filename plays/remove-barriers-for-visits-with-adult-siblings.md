Adult siblings (who have existing relationships with their younger siblings) should not have to jump through hoops for visits. This is especially true for siblings who are only just now aging out of foster care themselves.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Examine whether your system has barriers, like court petitions, background checks, or social worker sign-off, to familiar adult siblings setting up visits. (It is acceptable for some evaluation, like a background check, if the adult sibling is unknown to the sibling or the case, but now wants to be involved.)

* Leverage prudent parenting guidance to encourage visits with familiar adult siblings without Departmental involvement.

  costs:
    - None
  benefits:
    - Maintained sibling connections
    - Another supportive adult who can provide fun, transportation from school, and mentorship for younger children in care
