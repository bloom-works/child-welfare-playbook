Making a plan to keep youth connected with their entire network of supportive adults is critical, but generally requires reliable transportation to work. Case workers and resource parents can sometimes provide this transportation, but your system should make sure a robust array of transportation options are available for youth.{.t-large}

## How to do this

* Provide transit passes or ride-hailing app stipends for older youth. These youth can often navigate to their supportive adults on their own if they have the financial support to do so.

* Ask supportive adults to provide transportation. This can be a great way to keep youth connected with their supportive adults, and is often an activity adults are happy to provide and simply do not know is needed.
