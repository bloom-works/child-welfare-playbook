Create regular events and camps where separated siblings can come together and have fun.{.t-large}

  inspiration: >-
    * [Camp Connect](https://mrpa.org/fostering-connections-through-camp-connect/){target=_blank} in Maryland uses an existing camp facility, with a higher staff to camper ratio and on-site clinical social workers. The camp is funded by the Department and is free for children to attend, including children with higher levels of behaviors. They are flexible about what siblings can attend, including siblings who have been adopted.

    * [Camp to Belong](https://camptobelong.org){target=_blank} in Colorado

## How to do this

* Host a monthly (at least) event for separated siblings. Make it fun and seasonal. It could be as simple as meeting at a playground or petting zoo, or an existing community event like an outdoor kids' concert. Your foster parent support groups may be able to volunteer to coordinate events, or at least suggest locations or existing events to join.

* Invite separated siblings to existing events. If you are already having a community event, invite the families of separated siblings to all attend.

* Send separated sibling groups to regular camp. You don't need a special camp for separated siblings; you could raise funds or provide grants to send siblings to existing camps.

* Create a summer camp for separated siblings. This can be challenging to start, but you can collaborate with local non-profits, existing summer camps, and models from other states with existing sibling camps to create a pilot program for next summer. It could be an afternoon in the park with agency employees running activities at first; it doesn't have to be a week-long sleepaway camp.

  costs:
    - Varies
  benefits:
    - More opportunities for separated siblings to spend time together and make memories
    - Can be a neutral location for the resource families of separated siblings to first meet
